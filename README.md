# DigitSftpTransfer
Trade requests files are generated from d1g1t every hour until 2pm, and then every 30 minutes, 10 minutes and 5 minutes leading up to 4pm.       This will generate multiple files into the FTP folder from d1g1t to Q Wealth. These files need to be uploaded into another FTP folder from Q Wealth to NBIN.
